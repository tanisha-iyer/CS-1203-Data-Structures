// This will work for directed graphs as well since Dijkstra's algorithm will work as long as all weights are positive/non-negative. 
// The algorithm only looks at edges that are present in the graph. In a directed graph, an edge from u to v is not the same as an edge from v to u, which graph[u][v] condition takes care of.

// To improve the time complexity, we can use a different data structure. For example a binary search tree which is organized 
// according to the value of the nodes can make Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path be performed more efficiently. 
// The time complexity then becomes O(log(n)) where n is the number of vertices and edges in the graph

// src initialized to a priority queue with a distance of 0.
// The main loop continues under condition that it is not empty
// In each iteration, the vertex u with the smallest distance is removed from queue and added to a new array (storePath[])
